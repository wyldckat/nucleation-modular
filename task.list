*Tasks to do in the code for 1.6.x*:

  1. integrate/adapt the changes made by Anton into the release version of
  the script; <- done
  2. modify the "*versionning* mechanism" that is tightly coupled to Ubuntu
  versions into an abstract mechanism, i.e., define variables by generations,
  not Ubuntu versions;
  3. create a new function that detects what Linux box it's running on.
  Returns "Unknown" if not detected.
  4. Now with "Ubuntu" and "Unknown" options, put code that is "Ubuntu
  only" in one module script and copy-paste-change those same functions into 
  another module script for the "Unknown Linux" option.
  5. The unknown option will rely on user input to provide an additional
  on what generation the Linux box or with which Linux distro is it similar
  to. Either way, it will only provide hints on what packages should be
  installed in the Linux box.
  6. NOTE: if there are things that are Distro dependent and also
  OpenFOAM version dependent, then we can create even more module scripts.
  Hopefully this won't be necessary, but it could happen. So, in other words,
  do something like this on the Ubuntu module script (haven't made a code
  check on this ;) ):
    if [ "$OFversion" == "1.6.x" ]; then
      do_wget_module "ubuntu_of16x"
      import_module "ubuntu_of16x"
    else
      do_wget_module "ubuntu_of17x"
      import_module "ubuntu_of17x"
    fi


   2. add "use System OpenMPI" option;
   3. improve the dialog system:
      1. to include the custom options in a less *wreck-less* way;
      2. strictly separate options that are client side from server side
      installations (like OSMesa in ParaView);
   4. provide a summary of items that failed to build at the end of the
   installation;
   5. move all building logs into a single folder, i.e.,
   "$PATHOF/BuildLogs";
   6. make a nice little package with the related failed items logs, for the
   user to post online;
   7. add option to install Discretizer into the script; <- postponed
   8. finally, move/copy the script (and dependents) into the new repo (in a
   dedicated folder please!) and change the path to the repo in the new copy
   (variable OPENFOAM_UBUNTU_SCRIPT_REPO).

   2. find common and different items between scripts 1.6.x and 1.7.x:
      1. create a base script for launching the installation process, with
      the common functions between 1.6.x and 1.7.x and a GUI entry for picking the
      version;
      2. create two modular scripts (with functions and variable definitions
      only) that have the functions that are different between 1.6.x and 1.7.x.
   4. initiate process to *modularize* even further:
      5. start adding other distros!

*Tasks to do in the code for 1.7.x*:

   1. fork/branch (into a different folder) from the script in 1.6.x, in
   order to primarily make a working script for 1.7.x;
   2. make the script work with OpenFOAM 1.7.x:
      1. about 50% of the patches made for OpenFOAM 1.6.x are no longer
      usable in OpenFOAM 1.7.x, so fixing/removing them is a task;
      2. no longer exists an option to neither build nor use OpenFOAM gcc;
      3. have to figure out with which versions of Qt does ParaView 3.8.0
      build and work well!


Tasks yet to do in the documentation:

   - translating the FAQ in Portuguese to English;
   - adding FAQ entries that are still left unanswered;
   - create a simple tutorial on how to use the script (i.e., use the
   default/most used options);
   - create a more detailed tutorial, explaining the *repercussions* of each
   option :) .
