--------------------------------------
Done:
  - integrate/adapt the changes made by Anton into the release version of
  the script;
  - make architecture identification abstract:
    - i?86 -> x86
    - x86_64 -> x64
  - IMPORTANT: because I forgot about using "hg push", then Anton's changes
  weren't cloned into the modular version... will have to refit them into the
  new modular system with proper comment in the commit!

  - systems contemplated for now (variable INST_SYSTEM):
      ubuntu
      generic

    - SYSTEM_VERSION - here is kept the system's version

    - files and folders in the base folders will have same scripts of the
      same name in the folders $INST_SYSTEM:
        common
          aux_functions
          user_functions
          main_functions
        common/$INST_SYSTEM
          aux_functions
          user_functions
          main_functions
        of16x
          patches
          fixes
          user_functions
          main_functions
        of16x/$INST_SYSTEM
          patches
          fixes
          user_functions


  - create a new function that detects what Linux box it's running on.
  Returns "Generic" if not detected. <- didn't bother creating a function, it's
  streamlined in the initial code.

  - NOTE: if there are things that are Distro dependent and also
  OpenFOAM version dependent, then we can create even more module scripts.
  Hopefully this won't be necessary, but it could happen. <- done and with no need to make further downloads.

  - Functions for starting, continuing and ending the script's self-log functionality have been implemented.
    But if you just want to not log something, redirect to >&4. For example:
        echo "This won't be logged into the master script!" >&4

  - Move all building logs into a single folder, i.e., "$PATHOF/buildLogs", with subfolders per OF version.

  - change how our repo files are being downloaded/copied. Now they are assumed to be already downloaded
    (all came in a tar.gz package), so now what's left is to define the source folder+file and the file name

  - change options given via dialog from Yes/No to on/off, since this way it will be simpler
    to do some pre-setting of saved variables and such

  - modify the "*versionning* mechanism" that is tightly coupled to Ubuntu
  versions into an abstract mechanism. Now things related to specific systems are left on the side.

  - provide a summary of items that failed to build at the end of the
   installation, along with the option for making a nice little package
   with the related failed items logs, for the user to post online;
   - in the end give the final report and create the package,
   whether he/she likes it or not :) But posting is up to the user.

  - add "use System OpenMPI" option;

  - Now with "Ubuntu" and "Generic" options, put code that is "Ubuntu
  only" in one module script and copy-paste-change those same functions into
  another module script for the "Unknown Linux" option.
    - The unknown option will rely on user input to provide an additional
    on what generation the Linux box or with which Linux distro is it similar
    to. Either way, it will only provide hints on what packages should be
    installed in the Linux box, and will try to infer what might be missing...

  - In the installation mode dialog - typo, this should be 'current' instead of 'currenty'
  - During the build - "If you want to, you can follow the progress of this build process, by opening a new terminal and running:": The second comma is wrong IMO

  -bugs fixed:
    - GCC_VERSION not defined when it reaches "/home/nmgs/OF/ThirdParty-1.6/gcc-/platforms/linux64/lib64" AND
      we are using system libraries, not OpenFOAM's ones. <- fixed
    - /home/nmgs/OF/buildLogs/16x/ not created <- fixed
    - unTar didn't use pv <- fixed - had to redirect 2>&4 so we could see the bar
    - didn't build OpenFOAM, probably due to the previous folder not existing <- fixed - it was because the log file couldn't be created
    - when taring final report, there was a warning message about trailing '/' <- should be fixed...

--------------------------------------
Tasks to do:

  - bugs to fix:

  - basic tests complete - start implementation of OpenFOAM 1.7.x


--------------------------------------


--------------------------------------
Unsorted tasks:
   3. improve the dialog system:
      1. to include the custom options in a less *wreck-less* way;
      2. strictly separate options that are client side from server side
      installations (like OSMesa in ParaView);
   7. add option to install Discretizer into the script; <- postponed
   8. finally, move/copy the script (and dependents) into the new repo (in a
   dedicated folder please!) and change the path to the repo in the new copy
   (variable OPENFOAM_UBUNTU_SCRIPT_REPO).

   2. find common and different items between scripts 1.6.x and 1.7.x:
      1. create a base script for launching the installation process, with
      the common functions between 1.6.x and 1.7.x and a GUI entry for picking the
      version;
      2. create two modular scripts (with functions and variable definitions
      only) that have the functions that are different between 1.6.x and 1.7.x.
   4. initiate process to *modularize* even further:
      5. start adding other distros!

 *Tasks to do in the code for 1.7.x*:

   1. fork/branch (into a different folder) from the script in 1.6.x, in
   order to primarily make a working script for 1.7.x;
   2. make the script work with OpenFOAM 1.7.x:
      1. about 50% of the patches made for OpenFOAM 1.6.x are no longer
      usable in OpenFOAM 1.7.x, so fixing/removing them is a task;
      3. have to figure out with which versions of Qt does ParaView 3.8.0
      build and work well!

--------------------------------------



--------------------------------------
Tasks yet to do in the documentation:

   - translating the FAQ in Portuguese to English;
   - adding FAQ entries that are still left unanswered;
   - create a simple tutorial on how to use the script (i.e., use the
   default/most used options);
   - create a more detailed tutorial, explaining the *repercussions* of each
   option :) .
